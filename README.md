# LowPowerPCGame
A game I decided to make while I am away from my main computer.
I am using a Lenovo Yoga 300-11IBR to develop this game, which has the following specs:
<ul>
    <li>Intel Pentium N3710 (4 cores, 2.56 GHz)</li>
    <li>Integrated GPU</li>
    <li>4GB System RAM</li>
</ul>
The OS is Arch Linux with Cinnamon.
I am using raylib and C++17.
The challenge is to obtain 60+ FPS.
